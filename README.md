# ELISA
The enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay data analysis and visualization



### General information
SARS-CoV-2 Nucleocapsid protein (NP) is a common antigen for ELISA. NP specially purified from ribonucleic impurities and  NP contaminated with RNA were compared in 4 dilutions:  1:400 1:1600 1:6400 1:25600. The Anti-SARSCoV-2 Verification Panel for Serology Assays (NIBSC code: 20 / B770) was used to compare them. 23 samples are from convalescent plasma packs known to be Anti-SARS-CoV-2 positve. Also included are 14 plasmapacks known to be Anti-SARS-CoV-2 negative. OD/CO vaue were calculated as the ratio of the optical density for the test sample and the mean optical density in negative samples wells plus three times the standard deviation.
